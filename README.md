# ðŸ’° Bankist App

A simple banking app simulation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ðŸš€ What it does

- **User Login:** Users can log in with a username (derived from their name initials) and a 4-digit PIN.
- **Display Account Movements:** Shows all deposits and withdrawals as a list. Each entry shows if it was a deposit or withdrawal and the amount.
- **Calculate and Display Balance:** Sums all movements to show the current balance.
- **Summary:** Displays total money deposited, total money withdrawn, and interest earned on deposits. Interest is calculated per deposit using a fixed interest rate and only amounts to interest if it is at least 1 unit.
- **Money Transfer:** Logged-in users can transfer money to other users if they have enough balance and the recipient exists.
- **Loan Requests:** Users can request a loan, but the amount must be less than or equal to 10 times the largest deposit made.
- **Account Closure:** Users can close their account by confirming their username and PIN. This deletes their data from the system.
- **Sorting Movements:** The list of transactions can be sorted in ascending order.

## How it works

- Data for each account includes owner name, movements (array of deposits and withdrawals), interest rate, PIN, and account type.
- On login, the app verifies username and PIN, then welcomes the user while displaying his specific data.
- Movements are rendered dynamically in the UI, with deposits and withdrawals styled differently.
- Transfers and loans update the movements array and refresh the UI immediately.
- Closing an account removes it from the stored accounts list and hides the interface.
- Sorting toggles the order of transaction display.

## ðŸ§ª Testing User Accounts

To test the appâ€™s features, use one of the predefined accounts below. Usernames are generated from the ownersâ€™ full names by taking the first letter of each name part, all lowercase.

|------------------------|-------------|--------|
| Jonas Schmedtmann      | `js`        | `1111` |
| Jessica Davis          | `jd`        | `2222` |
| Steven Thomas Williams | `stw`       | `3333` |
